# Clarity Flow - Lexical Simplofication with BERT

The "Clarity-Flow" project aims to convert complex and convoluted language into simplified, easily understandable sentences. Identifies complex structures, and restructures them into simpler equivalents without compromising the original meaning or context.
With its advanced algorithms, Clarity-flow can convert complex words and phrases into simple, easy-to-understand language, making it easier for team members to collaborate and work together and understand the meaning of complex words and phrases.
The goal of lexical simplification (LS) is to simplify a sentence by substituting simpler words with complex ones that have the same meaning. A Simple Framework for Lexical Simplification : three steps: complicated word identity (CWI), substitute generation (SG) of complicated words, and filtering and replacement ranking (SR).
Word embedding-based LS systems were proposed as a complete solution to do away with the need for parallel corpora or lexical resources. As potential replacements, they identified the top ten words whose vectors have a closer cosine similarity to the complex word.
The primary objective of "Clarity- Flow" has been to streamline the readability of content without compromising its original context or meaning. By automating the identification and replacement of complex words with simpler alternatives, the project has aimed to cater to individuals with varying levels of language proficiency, cognitive abilities, or learning disabilities.
