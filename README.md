# Clarity Flow - BERT
The "Clarity-Flow" project aims to create an innovative text processing system known as SimpleText. This system specializes in converting complex and convoluted language into simplified, easily understandable sentences. 
The primary objective of SimpleText is to enhance readability and comprehension for a broader audience by transforming intricate text structures into clearer and more accessible formats. 
Employing advanced language techniques and machine learning algorithms, SimpleText systematically analyzes intricate sentences, identifies complex structures, and restructures them into simpler equivalents without compromising the original meaning or context. 
With its advanced algorithms, Clarity-flow can convert complex words and phrases into simple, easy-to-understand language, making it easier for team members to collaborate and work together and understand the meaning of complex words and phrases.
An exploration of BERT-based models and their effectiveness in natural language understanding and generation tasks. Emphasis on BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism and pre-training on large corpora for capturing context and semantics.
The goal of lexical simplification (LS) is to simplify a sentence by substituting simpler words with complex ones that have the same meaning.
Word embedding-based LS systems were proposed as a complete solution to do away with the need for parallel corpora or lexical resources. As potential replacements, they identified the top ten words whose vectors have a closer cosine similarity to the complex word.
The "Clarity-Flow" project represents a significant advancement in enhancing the accessibility and comprehension of written content by simplifying complex vocabulary within sentences.
Through the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project has successfully addressed the challenge of deciphering intricate terminology to improve readability for diverse audiences. 
The primary objective of "Clarity- Flow" has been to streamline the readability of content without compromising its original context or meaning. By automating the identification and replacement of complex words with simpler alternatives, the project has aimed to cater to individuals with varying levels of language proficiency, cognitive abilities, or learning disabilities. 
Through extensive algorithm development and rigorous testing, "Clarity-Flow" has demonstrated its ability to accurately recognize complex terms within sentences and offer appropriate substitutions while ensuring coherence and fidelity to the original message. The user-friendly interface facilitates easy input of text or sentences for processing, making it a valuable tool for various domains and industries.
